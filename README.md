# CanvasHacks
Userscripts developed by LJMU School of Education, to enhance the Canvas VLE / LMS.

Visit the individual directories for README's on each hack.

* [Assessments](https://github.com/LJMUSoE/CanvasHacks/tree/master/Assessment) - Allow rubrics to be imported from a spreadsheet rather than the standard Canvas rubric builder. Adds some basic enhancements to help with file extensions for uploaded submissions.
* [Page editor](https://github.com/LJMUSoE/CanvasHacks/tree/master/Editor]) - Adds a 'beautifier' to the raw HTML editor, that tabs the markup so it is easier to read and edit. Makes it easy to add column layouts that conform to Web/Accessibility standards.
